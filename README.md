to generate a slideshow that can be presented from a ANSI terminal using ascii and UTF8 fonts.
it is a work in progress and the first version is used to present the PerlayStation Games Console
at TPRC 2023 in Toronto. It is currently crude and is a quick and dirty application written in a
short time, but expected to improve.

#### Features

* Navigates with key presses
